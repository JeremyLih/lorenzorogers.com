Four days. Can I do it?\n\nProbably. _Is it clear that I'm not done my trip at the time of writing this?_\n\n## Day one\n\nNothing major.\nWe left Vancouver, suffered the delays of existing in Vancouver, and then watched the scenery. Not much new scenery- most of the Fraser Valley looks the same.\n\nSleeping was a nightmare, but I'm betting it's just lack of experience. I tried so many different configurations, having special success with 'fetal position over two chairs' and 'on your side hudded between bags,' but still I'd like to find a more comfortable approach.\n\n## Day two\n\nAt 01:00, I woke up in Kamloops. So did everyone else. Probably just a smoke stop or something, not very clear. It was a nightmare to get back to sleep.\n\nAt 06:30ish, I woke up for realsies. I think I got a nearly adequate amount of sleep, and no drowsiness could keep me from the stunning views outside my window. TLDR: The Rocky Mountains are very beautiful. (I'd attach a photo but this blog system is bare-bones enough as it is)\n\nBy noon (in Mountain time!) we made it to Jasper. Never been there, but it's quite a beautiful and cute little town. I got myself a hot chocolate (because of course I did) and something to eat for lunch. Following that, our train started the process of finally leaving the rockies, onto the next part of Canada. The praries.. sort of. Because there's snow and all it's all quite visually pleasant and makes you feel rather cosy inside your cabin. I hope that we can keep seeing snow all the way into Toronto!\n\n17:00. No dice. Once we even could smell Edmonton, the snow was more than gone. Replaced with what I can only describe as the beigest province, Alberta isn't very high-ranking in the scenery department. Now, this isn't really their fault.. but perhaps if they had a dedicated corridor for passenger rail traffic I wouldn't have to spend so much miserable time looking out the window.\n\n_Post will be updated as trip continues._","src/data/blog/via-rail-experience.md","5eb2a88870aec85b",{"html":39,"metadata":40},"\u003Ch1 id=\"vancouver-to-toronto-four-days-can-i-do-it\">Vancouver to Toronto.
